*FoxyVPN signs in with a Firefox account, obtains a proxy pass from Mozilla's
Guardian service, and carries the whole device's traffic through Firefox VPN's
Fastly edge over an HTTP/2 tunnel. It is a native Kotlin app with a
Jetpack Compose (Material 3) UI.*

## 🚀 How to use?

1. **Get a Firefox account.** If you do not have one, create it for free at
   [accounts.firefox.com](https://accounts.firefox.com/signup).
2. **Install the APK** from the project's releases.
3. **Sign in** with that account's email and password.
4. **Pick a location** and tap the power button.

> [!NOTE]
> **No subscription is required.** FoxyVPN runs on the free **50 GB of monthly
VPN traffic Mozilla includes with a Firefox account** for browser users, which
is the same allowance the Firefox browser's built-in VPN uses. Once the
allowance is used up for the month, connections stop working until it resets.
